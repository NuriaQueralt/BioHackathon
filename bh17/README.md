# This is the application of the neuro-symbolic learning algorithm on the NGLY1 deficiency (OMIM:615273, ORPHA:404454)-seeded hetionet
- I will explain the steps to apply the learning algorithm, whilst read the readme_embeddings file. More [info](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17sduqUMjJxYBKIuTAXGdRRAuclsmP_ZcW9HXSLHCaYk/edit?usp=sharing).
- I will explain how to use the feature embedding vectors representing the graph structure to make predictions on new drug-disease edges
